#AdaQuiz: Adaptive Quizzes with flow control

AdaQuiz is a new activity type in Moodle. Based on Moodle Quiz, it enables the teacher to guide the learner activity based on their score in different questions.

In a regular quiz, the student jumps from one question to the next. AdaQuiz module allows the quiz author to control the jump of the student to another question based on their performance.

AdaQuiz first displays an initial question and, depending on the jump rule which is usually the score value within a predefined threshold, the next question is chosen. This process continues until a terminal question is reached.

A carefully planned adaptive quiz results on a customized itinerary of questions that adapts to the knowledge of any student with flexibility. Authors can easily create adaptive quiz activities just selecting the questions and the jump rules.

Teachers are able to review the questions that a student has attempted, its scoring and the choices that AdaQuiz has done.
