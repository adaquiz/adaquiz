ADAPTIVE QUIZ by Maths for more S.L.
====================================

This Moodle module is a quiz engine that builds quizzes where the the question
structure within a quiz is a directed graph instead of an ordered sequence. A
student attempt is then a walk through this graph. The grades in a question will
determine the next question to be answered. It is specially powerful in
combination with WIRIS quizzes.
